# nber.connectR
An R connection to NBER's Public Use Data Archive

## Plan

1. Build out infrastructure -- setup the linking necessary to read in major datasets available on NBER
2. Generalize functions to read in NBER data -- start with large, important survey data and branch out from there
3. Document -- write function to help users to search through datasets available on NBER and decide what data is right for them
4. Specialized functions for processing NBER data and getting it to workable formats
5. Advertising -- build out a NBER data dashboard to show off the cool things that the package can do
